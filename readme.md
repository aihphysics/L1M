# L1M Rocket Project

## Introduction
Hello! You've found my (other) rocket project! Minimum diameter!

* Phenolic body, 31.8mm outer diameter.
* PLA nosecone, conical, 6.9:1 ratio with diameter. Pointy!
* We're going for an 'L1' grade motor this time :) 29mm motors.
* Small avionics stack, operating off of a TINY2040, using a DPS310 based board for altimeter, and a MPU-9250 9DoF IMU for recording motion.
* 5 forward pointing fins, plywood, laser-cut at 3mm thickness.
* Anchor points will need to be lathed, that'll be tricky!
* Large selection of F and H motors tested.
* Supersonic _potential_. (I really wouldn't recommend it).
