# L1M Rocket Project

## Introduction
This is Assegai F3600, an first-revision 29mm minimum-diameter rocket.

* Total length 901mm.
* Phenolic body, 31.8mm outer diameter.
* Haack series LV nosecone, fully replaceable.
* 29mm motor mount, capable of taking up to 6GXL length cases.
* Small avionics stack, operating off of a TINY2040, using a DPS310 based board for altimeter, and a MPU-9250 9DoF IMU for recording motion. This isn't going in the initial launches.
* 4 delta fins, plywood, laser-cut at 3mm thickness, rounded and filleted.
* Anchor points lathed from delrin and aluminium.
* Large selection of F and H motors simulated.
* Supersonic _potential_. (I really wouldn't recommend it).
* Too much epoxy.
