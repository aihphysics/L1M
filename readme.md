# L0 Rocket Project

## Introduction
Hello! You've found my (other) rocket project! 

* Phenolic body, 31.8mm outer diameter.
* PLA nosecone, conical, 4:1 ratio with diameter.
* We're going for an 'L1' grade motor this time :)
* Small avionics stack, operating off of a TINY2040, using a DPS310 based board for altimeter, and a MPU-9250 9DoF IMU for recording motion.
* 5 forward pointing fins, plywood, laser-cut at 3mm thickness.
